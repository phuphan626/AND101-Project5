# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: Phu Phan

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

## Summary

NASA APOD API is an android app that will display the images from NASA with the search date from user.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: ðŸ˜†ðŸ¤’ðŸ¤•

## Application Features


The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [x] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is the "date" parameter for the API. It will request the image from the date specified by user
- [x ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query


## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is NASA APOD API
